      + "disappointing for the past three quarters for our data analytics "
      + "product suite. We have a competitive data analytics product "
      + "suite in the industry. But we need to do our job selling it! "
      + "We need to acknowledge and fix our sales challenges. "
      + "We canâ€™t blame the economy for our lack of execution! "
      + "We are missing critical sales opportunities. "
      + "Our product is in no way inferior to the competitor products. "
      + "Our clients are hungry for analytical tools to improve their "
      + "business outcomes. Economy has nothing to do with it.";
