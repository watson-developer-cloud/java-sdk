<h1>Use cases for the Personality Insights service</h1>

  <p>
    The Personality Insights service lends itself to an almost limitless
    number of potential applications. By leveraging the Big Five personality
    characteristics, Needs, and Values, businesses and individuals alike
    can make more informed and more insightful decisions, and make more
    effective use of limited resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Businesses can market to the most receptive target audience, they
    can acquire and retain more customers, and they can develop services
    that connect individuals and groups more effectively. Individuals can
    optimize how they market themselves to potential employers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following sections suggest just a few of the potential applications
    of the Personality Insights service. Use this information to kickstart
    your own applications or to develop your own innovative ideas.
  </p>

<span class="anchor" id="ucMarketing"></span>
<section class="bodySection">
<h2>Targeted marketing</h2>

  <p>
    Imagine an in-store retail experience that involves an interactive kiosk.
    Customers log in to the kiosk with a social media handle such as a Twitter
    ID. The kiosk quickly presents a set of personalized product and service
    offerings based on the customers' personality characteristics, needs, and
    values. The products and services include marketing campaigns, coupons,
    trial offers, and recommendations that are suited to each individual
    customer. The results match the right offerings to the most receptive
    customers, improving both the effectiveness of the offers and customer
    satisfaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the Personality Insights service, businesses can make this idea
    a reality. By leveraging a combination of enterprise and social media
    data, businesses can apply analytics to develop deeper portraits of
    individual customers. They can use the results for better-quality lead
    generation, finer-grained customer segmentation, and focused marketing
    that is both more relevant and more personal.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using the Personality Insights service with other IBM offerings, such
    as Unica and BigInsights Social Data Accelerator (SDA), enterprises
    can derive insights from a vast pool of transactional and social media
    data. These insights can help businesses to
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <p>
	Extract early, near real-time signals of customers' purchase
	intentions to identify quality leads.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Derive customer portraits that include intrinsic psychological
	preferences, which can dictate customers' economic decisions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Create hyper-personalized marketing plans based on customers'
	intrinsic and behavioral preferences to improve conversion rates.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Find and engage the right target audience at the right time to
	launch effective marketing campaigns.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Based on social media data, businesses can dynamically identify and
    engage with high-value customers from among millions of loyalty program
    members to
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <p>
	Dynamically improve customer satisfaction and actively manage brand
	reputation by delivering the personalized products and services that
	customers need, when they need them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Take advantage of business opportunities to test new offerings by
	making product trials available to customers who are more likely to
	value them.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

</section>

<span class="anchor" id="ucAcquisition"></span>
<section class="bodySection">
<h2>Customer acquisition</h2>

  <p>
    Personality portraits that are generated by the Personality Insights
    service can help businesses strengthen existing customer relationships
    and identify new customers. For example, people whose personalities evince
    a greater tendency for orderliness, self-discipline, and cautiousness and
    less immoderation are more likely than the random population to redeem
    coupons. Similarly, people's propensity to purchase specific kinds of
    products correlates with their personality characteristics. For example,
    shoppers whose personalities tend toward openness and conscientiousness
    are more likely to purchase organic milk, fruits, and vegetables.
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    Retailers benefit from sending coupons to people whose social media
    content exhibits the intersection of these personality characteristics,
    whether they are existing or potential customers. By not sending coupons
    to those customers who do not redeem them, businesses save direct marketing
    costs. They also avoid flooding customers with coupons that they do not
    want and will discard, a pattern that can eventually lead customers to
    discard coupons from the retailer altogether.
  </p>

  <p>
    Combining personality portraits with life events inferred from social
    media and with existing enterprise demographic data can yield meaningful
    insights into the consumption patterns and preferences of individual
    customers. For instance, families with a newborn are likely to begin
    purchasing diapers. Retailers can use the Personality Insights service
    to infer whether such families are more likely to prefer cloth or
    disposable diapers, and they can send the families coupons that match
    that inference. By combining personality characteristics and life events
    in this way, retailers can leverage the added insight to increase customer
    response and to generate new customers.
    <!--
    Sending coupons for such products to customers whose personality
    characteristics and life situations make them more likely to use
    them can increase customer response and generate new customers.
    -->
  </p>

  <p>
    Businesses can also analyze large groups of customers based on their
    publicly available social media content and behavior to capitalize
    on targeted revenue-generating opportunities. The Personality Insights
    service can help businesses improve the success of future marketing
    campaigns by understanding which messages or products appeal to which
    customer segments. A business would first cluster customers with known
    behavior in terms of personality characteristics. It would then derive
    mapping rules from personality to behavior based on segmentation
    knowledge gleaned from the clusters.
  </p>

<span class="anchor" id="ucCare"></span>
<section class="bodySection">
<h2>Customer care</h2>

  <p>
    Over the course of the customer engagement lifecycle, enterprises can
    use the Personality Insights service to build better, more lasting
    relationships with their customers. By better understanding customers
    and responding to them as individuals, businesses can
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <p>
	Recommend and guide customers' actions through personalized
	exchanges across different channels such as online chats, social
	media engagements, and email communications. Enhanced understanding
	can lead to improved interactions with customers, which in turn can
	improve brand reputation, increase customer retention, and encourage
	up- and cross-sales opportunities.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Use customers' personality characteristics to determine which
	interaction medium to use, what web page to display, and what video
	to share.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Present agents with information about a client who contacts the
	business. This information can let the agent give the client a more
	personalized experience by providing hints about how to talk to the
	client.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Consider a traveler who uses an online travel service to obtain
    recommendations for places to visit or dine. The travel service
    can examine the traveler's personality characteristics and suggest
    personalized site-seeing locations and restaurants that suit the
    traveler's personality. The service can go even further by working
    with local merchants to offer personalized coupons that match the
    traveler's interests.
  </p>

</section>

<span class="anchor" id="ucConnections"></span>
<section class="bodySection">
<h2>Personal connections</h2>

  <p>
    The Personality Insights service can match individuals and groups.
    Possible permutations can encourage individual-to-individual,
    individual-to-group, group-to-individual, and group-to-group connections
    by matching personality characteristics in the following domains:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <p>
	Personal dating via individual-to-individual matching.
      </p>
    </li>
    <!--
    <li>
      <p>
	Healthcare provider to patient. A cognitive-care use case developed
	by the IBM Australia team improves the satisfaction level of such
	interactions by matching patients with doctors who have a compatible
	personality.
      </p>
    </li>
    -->
    <li>
      <p>
	Travel agent to traveler by offering suitable vacation packages to
	appropriate travelers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Customer care agent to caller by matching call-center agents to
	callers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Investment broker to investor by matching brokers to investors with
	whom they are likely to connect.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Suppose that a client contacts a brokerage firm to learn which investment
    funds to pursue. This scenario suggests a matching use case that leverages
    the client's personality characteristics to better satisfy the client's
    needs. By using the Personality Insights service, the firm can match the
    client to a broker who matches the client's personality and can suggest
    investment options that suit the client's preferences and inclinations.
    Moreover, the broker who is assigned to the client can use the service
    to prepare an individualized message for the client.
  </p>

</section>

<span class="anchor" id="ucResume"></span>
<section class="bodySection">
<h2>Resume writing</h2>

  <p>
    A recent graduate needs to write a resume that is optimized for industries
    that match the graduate's degree and interests. An application from a
    recent Watson Hackathon suggests developing optimal industry-specific
    resumes from excellent past examples. The application can use Watson
    services to determine the characteristics of optimal baseline resumes
    for maximum resonance with each industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    After creating a resume, the graduate uses the application to learn how
    well the resume compares with the optimal baseline. The application uses
    the Personality Insights service to analyze the resume. It highlights
    potential issues and suggests changes to better align the personality
    characteristics and values that are disclosed by the resume with those
    of the baseline.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, the application could leverage the Message Resonance service
    to suggest wording that better resonates with terminology from the
    baseline. By applying the Concept Expansion service, the tool could
    also suggest other industries the candidate might not have considered,
    expanding the candidate's potential employment options.
  </p>
