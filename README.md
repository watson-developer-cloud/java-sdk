## Installation

Download the [jar][releases], and add it to your project.  
Now, you are ready to see some [examples](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk/tree/master/examples/java/com/ibm/watson/developer_cloud).

##### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.ibm.watson.developer_cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>java-wrapper</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
##### Gradle

```gradle
'com.ibm.watson.developer_cloud:java-wrapper:2.0.0'
```

## Usage

The examples below assume that you already have service credentials. If not,
you will have to create a service in [Bluemix][bluemix].

If you are running your application in Bluemix, you don't need to specify the
credentials; the library will get them for you by looking at the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

## Getting the Service Credentials
You will need the `username` and `password` (`api_key` for AlchemyAPI) credentials for each service. Service credentials are different from your Bluemix account username and password.

To get your service credentials, follow these steps:
 1. Log in to Bluemix at https://bluemix.net.

 1. Create an instance of the service:
     1. In the Bluemix **Catalog**, select the service you want to use.
     1. Under **Add Service**, type a unique name for the service instance in the Service name field. For example, type `my-service-name`. Leave the default values for the other options.
     1. Click **Create**.

 1. Copy your credentials:
     1. On the left side of the page, click **Service Credentials** to view your service credentials.
     1. Copy `username` and `password`(`api_key` for AlchemyAPI).

Once you have credentials, copy config.properties.example to src/test/resources/config.properties, and fill them in as necessary.

## Questions

If you are having difficulties using the APIs or have a question about the IBM
Watson Services, please ask a question on
[dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/ask/?topics=watson)
or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-watson).


## IBM Watson Services
The Watson Developer Cloud offers a variety of services for building cognitive
applications.

### Alchemy Language
[Alchemy Language][alchemy_language] offers 12 API functions as part of its text analysis service, each of which uses sophisticated natural language processing techniques to analyze your content and add high-level semantic information.

Use the [Sentiment Analysis][sentiment_analysis] endpoint to identify positive/negative sentiment within a sample text document.

```java
AlchemyLanguage service = new AlchemyLanguage();
service.setApiKey("<api_key>");

Map<String,Object> params = new HashMap<String, Object>();
params.put(AlchemyLanguage.TEXT, "IBM Watson won the Jeopardy television show hosted by Alex Trebek");
DocumentSentiment sentiment =  service.getSentiment(params);

System.out.println(sentiment);
```

### Alchemy Vision
[Alchemy Vision][alchemy_vision] uses deep learning innovations to understand a picture's content and context. It sees complex visual scenes in their entirety —without needing any textual clues— leveraging a holistic approach to understand the objects, faces, and words in an image.

Example: Extract keywords from an image.

```java
AlchemyVision service = new AlchemyVision();
service.setApiKey("<api_key>");

Map<String,Object> params = new HashMap<String, Object>();
params.put(AlchemyVision.IMAGE, new File("src/test/resources/obama.jpg"));
ImageKeywords keywords =  service.getImageKeywords(params);

System.out.println(keywords);
```

### Alchemy Data News
[Alchemy Data News][alchemy_data_news] indexes 250k to 300k English language news and blog articles every day with historical search available for the past 60 days.
Example: Get the volume data from the last 7 days using 12hs of time slice.

```java
AlchemyDataNews service = new AlchemyDataNews();
service.setApiKey("<api_key>");

VolumeResult result = service.getVolume("now-7d", "now", "12h");

System.out.println(result);
```

### Concept Expansion
Map euphemisms or colloquial terms to more commonly understood phrases using
the [Concept Expansion][concept_expansion] service.
Example: Create a job, wait for it to finish, and then retrieve results.

```java
ConceptExpansion service = new ConceptExpansion();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

String[] seeds = new String[]{"motrin", "tylenol", "aspirin"};
String label = "medicine";
service.setDataset(ConceptExpansionDataset.MT_SAMPLES);
Job job = service.createJob(label, seeds);

while (service.getJobStatus(job) == Job.Status.AWAITING_WORK
		|| service.getJobStatus(job) == Job.Status.IN_FLIGHT) {
	try {
		Thread.sleep(4000);
	} catch (InterruptedException e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}
}

System.out.println(service.getJobResult(job));
```

### Concept Insights
Use the Concept Insights service to identify words in the text that
correspond to concepts in a Wikipedia graph.

```java
ConceptInsights service = new ConceptInsights();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

Annotations annotations = service.annotateText(Graph.WIKIPEDIA,
    "IBM Watson won the Jeopardy television show hosted by Alex Trebek");

System.out.println(annotations);
```

### Dialog
Returns the dialog list using the [Dialog][dialog] service.

```java
DialogService service = new DialogService();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

List<Dialog> dialogs = service.getDialogs();
System.out.println(dialogs);
```

### Document Conversion
The [Document Conversion][document_conversion] service allows to convert pdf, word, and html documents into formats useful to other Watson Cognitive services. Target formats include normalized html, plain text, and sets of potential answers for Watson question answering. You can convert documents synchronously one at a time, or asynchronously in batches

Returns the document list using the [Document Conversion][document_conversion] service.

```java
DocumentConversion service = new DocumentConversion();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

File doc = new File("src/test/resources/document_conversion/word-document-heading-input.doc");
Answers htmlToAnswers = service.convertDocumentToAnswer(doc, null);
System.out.println(htmlToAnswers);
```

### Language Translation
Select a domain, then identify or select the language of text, and then translate the text from one supported language to another.  
Example: Translate 'hello' from English to Spanish using the [Language Translation][language_translation] service.

```java
LanguageTranslation service = new LanguageTranslation();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

TranslationResult translationResult = service.translate("hello", "en", "es");
System.out.println(translationResult);
```

### Natural Language Classifier
Use [Natural Language Classifier](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/nl-classifier/) service to create a classifier instance by providing a set of representative strings and a set of one or more correct classes for each as training. Then use the trained classifier to classify your new question for best matching answers or to retrieve next actions for your application.

```java
NaturalLanguageClassifier service = new NaturalLanguageClassifier();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

Classification classification = service.classify("<classifier-id>", "Is it sunny?");
System.out.println(classification);
```

**Note:** You will need to create and train a classifier in order to be able to classify phrases.


### Personality Insights
Use linguistic analytics to infer personality and social characteristics, including Big Five, Needs, and Values, from text.  
Example: Analyze text and get a personality profile using the [Personality Insights][personality_insights] service.

```java
PersonalityInsights service = new PersonalityInsights();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

// Demo content from Moby Dick by Hermann Melville (Chapter 1)
String text = "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having "
    + "little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, "
    + "I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. "
    + "It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. "
    + "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, "
    + "drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before "
    + "coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially "
    + "whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral "
    + "principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically "
    + "knocking people's hats off-then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. "
    + "This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself "
    + "upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. "
    + "If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish "
    + "very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me. There now is your insular "
    + "city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs-commerce surrounds "
    + "it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward.";

Profile profile = service.getProfile(text);
System.out.println(profile);
```

**Note:** Don't forget to update the `text` variable! Also, if you experience
authentication errors, remember that the Personality Insights service is not
a free service.


### Relationship Extraction
Analyze an English news article and get the relationships between sentence
components (nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, etc.) by using the
[Relationship Extraction][relationship_extraction] service.

```java
RelationshipExtraction service = new RelationshipExtraction();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

service.setDataset(RelationshipExtractionDataset.ENGLISH_NEWS);
String response = service.extract("IBM Watson Developer Cloud");
System.out.println(response);
```

### Speech to Text
Use the [Speech to Text][speech_to_text] service to recognize the text from a .wav file.

```java
SpeechToText service = new SpeechToText();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

File audio = new File("src/test/resources/sample1.wav");

SpeechResults transcript = service.recognize(audio, HttpMediaType.AUDIO_WAV);
System.out.println(transcript);
```

#### WebSocket support

Speech to Text supports WebSocket, the url is:  
  `wss://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize`  

We recommend you use [this](http://java-websocket.org/) java client.

### Text to Speech
Use the [Text to Speech][text_to_speech] service to get the available voices to synthesize.

```java
TextToSpeech service = new TextToSpeech();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

List<Voice> voices = service.getVoices();
System.out.println(voices);
```

### Tone Analyzer
Use the [Tone Analyzer][tone_analyzer] service to get the tone of your email.

```java
ToneAnalyzer service = new ToneAnalyzer();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

String text = "I know the times are difficult! Our sales have been "
	+ "disappointing for the past three quarters for our data analytics "
	+ "product suite. We have a competitive data analytics product "
	+ "suite in the industry. But we need to do our job selling it! "
	+ "We need to acknowledge and fix our sales challenges.";

// Call the service and get the tone
Tone tone = service.getTone(text, Scorecard.EMAIL);
System.out.println(tone);
```


### Tradeoff Analytics
Use the [Tradeoff Analytics][tradeoff_analytics] service to find the best
phone that minimizes price and weight and maximizes screen size.

```java
TradeoffAnalytics service = new TradeoffAnalytics();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

Problem problem = new Problem("phone");

String price = "price";
String ram = "ram";
String screen = "screen";

// Define the objectives
List<Column> columns = new ArrayList<Column>();
problem.setColumns(columns);

columns.add(new NumericColumn().withRange(0, 100).withKey(price).withGoal(Goal.MIN).withObjective(true));
columns.add(new NumericColumn().withKey(screen).withGoal(Goal.MAX).withObjective(true));
columns.add(new NumericColumn().withKey(ram).withGoal(Goal.MAX));

// Define the options to choose
List<Option> options = new ArrayList<Option>();
problem.setOptions(options);

HashMap<String, Object> galaxySpecs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
galaxySpecs.put(price, 50);
galaxySpecs.put(ram, 45);
galaxySpecs.put(screen, 5);
options.add(new Option("1", "Galaxy S4").withValues(galaxySpecs));

HashMap<String, Object> iphoneSpecs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
iphoneSpecs.put(price, 99);
iphoneSpecs.put(ram, 40);
iphoneSpecs.put(screen, 4);
options.add(new Option("2", "iPhone 5").withValues(iphoneSpecs));

HashMap<String, Object> optimusSpecs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
optimusSpecs.put(price, 10);
optimusSpecs.put(ram, 300);
optimusSpecs.put(screen, 5);
options.add(new Option("3", "LG Optimus G").withValues(optimusSpecs));

// Call the service and get the resolution
Dilemma dilemma = service.dilemmas(problem);
System.out.println(dilemma);
```

### Visual Insights
Use the [Visual Insights][visual_insights] to get insight into the themes present in a collection of images based on their visual appearance/content.

```java
VisualInsights service = new VisualInsights();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

File images = new File("src/test/resources/images.zip");
Summary summary = service.getSummary(images);

System.out.println(summary);
```

### Visual Recognition
Use the [Visual Recognition][visual_recognition] service to recognize the
following picture.

![Car](http://visual-recognition-demo.mybluemix.net/images/73388.jpg)

```java
VisualRecognition service = new VisualRecognition();
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");

File image = new File("src/test/resources/car.png");

LabelSet labelSet = new LabelSet();
labelSet.withLabelGroup("Auto Racing").withLabelGroup("Sports");

RecognizedImage recognizedImage = service.recognize(image, labelSet);
System.out.println(recognizedImage);
```

## Android
he library supports Android 2.3 and above. For Java, the minimum requirement is 1.7.  
It depends on [OkHttp][] and [gson][].


## Running in Bluemix
When running in Bluemix, the library will automatically get the credentials from `VCAP_SERVICES`.
If you have more than one plan, you can use `BluemixUtils` to get the service credentials for an specific plan.

```java
PersonalityInsights service = new PersonalityInsights();
String apiKey = BluemixUtils.getAPIKey(service.getName(), BluemixUtils.PLAN_STANDARD);
service.setApiKey(apiKey);
```

## Build + Test

To build and test the project you can use [Gradle][] (version 1.x): or [Apache Maven][apache_maven].

Gradle:

  ```sh
  $ cd java-sdk
  $ gradle jar  # build jar file (build/libs/watson-developer-cloud-2.0.0.jar)
  $ gradle test # run tests
  ```

or Maven:

  ```sh
  $ cd java-sdk
  $ mvn install
  ```

## Working with Eclipse and Intellij IDEA

If you want to work on the code in an IDE instead of a text editor you can
easily create project files with gradle:

  ```sh
  $ gradle idea     # Intellij IDEA
  $ gradle eclipse  # Eclipse
  ```

or maven:

  ```sh
  $ mvn idea:idea # Intellij IDEA
  $ mvn eclipse:eclipse # Eclipse
  ```
