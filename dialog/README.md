# Dialog
The [Dialog service][dialog] was deprecated on August 15, 2016. Existing instances of the service stopped functioning on August 9, 2017. Users of the Dialog service were expected to migrate their applications to use the Conversation service. If you did not migrate your Dialog service instance in time, you can now create a Conversation service instance instead.
