// Demo content from Moby Dick by Hermann Melville (Chapter 1)
String text = "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having "
    + "little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, "
    + "I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. "
    + "It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. "
    + "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, "
    + "drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before "
    + "coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially "
    + "whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral "
    + "principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically "
    + "knocking people's hats off-then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. "
    + "This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself "
    + "upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. "
    + "If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish "
    + "very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me. There now is your insular "
    + "city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs-commerce surrounds "
    + "it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward.";

ProfileOptions options = new ProfileOptions.Builder().text(text).build();
Profile profile = service.profile(options).execute();

System.out.println(profile);
```

**Note:** Don't forget to update the `text` variable! Also, if you experience
authentication errors, remember that the Personality Insights service is not
a free service.
