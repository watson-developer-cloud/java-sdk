/**
 * The IBM Watson Retrieve and Rank service helps users find the most relevant information for their query by using a
 * combination of search and machine learning algorithms to detect "signals" in the data. Built on top of Apache Solr,
 * developers load their data into the service, train a machine learning model based on known relevant results, then
 * leverage this model to provide improved results to their end users based on their question or query.
